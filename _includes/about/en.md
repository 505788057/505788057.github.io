Hi, welcome to my blog. My name is Vitae, and the name comes from Latin, 
so you don't have to think this name is strange anymore. 
I graduated from Tianjin Nankai High school. I received my bachelor 
degree in Jiangnan University [School of IoT Engineering](http://iot.jiangnan.edu.cn/), majoring in automation. 
I once spurned this major to be behind the times, and the Uni has not kept pace with the times, 
but now I am striving for academic attainment and longing for becoming stronger.
I have worked in [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com.cn/) </a> CC / DA 
department, engaged in the development and software testing of 
autonomous driving software.

##### My Programming Languages Spectrum

I generally prefer languages that are close to ML ("Meta Language"), i.e. _mostly functional programming_. This should explain most of my picks e.g. JavaScript within dynamically-typed's, Scala within JVM's, Rust within unmanaged's.

##### Hardware Development Spectrum

As an electronic DIY enthusiast, I am familiar with various controllers and like to do some interesting projects.
